# How to use
In order to feed this python script videos to test, you need to create a "sorted" folder with this arborescence :
- snowfall -> day/night -> nothing/smallSnow/snowy/lotSnowy
- snowOnRoad -> day/night -> desnowed/partiallySnowy/snowy

every subsubfolder countains videos to be tested
for snowOnRoad, you need a ref.mp4 video in both day and night folders
